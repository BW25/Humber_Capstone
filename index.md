### November 21, 2019 (Week 10)
The PCB enclosure has been created, and now all hardware and software has been completed.

With no more expenses left to make, the final budget is as detailed in the budget.

The project is also on schedule, and work is beginning on the project presentation and build instructions.

### November 14, 2019 (Week 9)
The PCB has been tested with the development platform.

With the PCB confirmed to be functional, work is now beginning on the hardware enclosure, as per the project schedule.

The proposal is being adhered to, and the project is on budget.
